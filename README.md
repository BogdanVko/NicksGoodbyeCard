# NicksGoodbyeCard
This is a simple Goodbye card program written in Go. This program will output the main messages followed by a list of messages from each colleageue (picked in random order). Each colleague can have more than 1 message that will display each run at random as well.
You should be able to make a Pull Request here, and I will merge it.
Each signing colleague has to have at least 1 message writtenfor Nick in the list of messages that corresponds to them; please edit the `signCardHere` list in order to append a message.

You have to find a struct in the list with your name and add/del messages as you please. Also feel free to add people to this, it will help a lot!

Feel free to change the code however you wish! I created this really quickly just to provide a basic framework for us to give Nick an original goodbye card. If you want to just add some 
goodbye wishes and that's it - go for it, if you want to change the code in any other way - go for it :D

I am thinking to give Nick both the executable and the code of this when he's leaving, but we can decide to not give him the code, it's up to us to decide :)

this is how it will look like (for now)
